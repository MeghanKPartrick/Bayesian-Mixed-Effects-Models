<h1>Bayesian Mixed Effects Models</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is based off of the textbook "Extending the Linear Model with R" by Julian J. Faraway. These are exercises completed based off of Chapter 12: Bayesian Mixed Effects Models. The packages rstan and INLA are both used to fit a one-way ANOVA model. Based off of these models summaries of posteriors, credible intervals, posterior modes, and posterior means are all calculated. rstan provides the ability to easily plots posterior distributions, while ggplot2 helps to create density plots when using INLA. While using rstan, probabilities can easily be computed to compare these distributions.
